"""Analysis algorithms for PA tuning.

Two independent algorithms are run on every sweep, side-by-side, so we can compare them
empirically:

1. **Phase-lag (cross-correlation)** — for each K, build the commanded extrusion-velocity
   square wave and the measured loadcell trace on a common time grid, cross-correlate
   them, and find the sub-sample peak via parabolic interpolation. The lag at peak
   correlation is the "PA error". Linear-fit lag-vs-K → solve for lag = 0 → optimal K.

2. **Integral / area fit (Snapmaker-style)** — for each K, integrate
   `(loadcell - mean) * direction_of_transition` over a window CENTERED on each
   velocity transition. With perfect tracking, half the window sits in each leg's
   plateau and the contributions cancel → total = 0. When force lags, the
   post-transition half still reads the pre-transition value → negative. When force
   overshoots/leads, positive. Linear-fit area-vs-K → solve for area = 0 → optimal K.

   The legacy `sign(d_command/dt)` formulation (only ~5% duty cycle under our
   accel-limited ramp) is computed in parallel as `integral_area_legacy` so we can
   visually verify the centered-window form actually responds to K differences.

Both methods reduce to a 1-D linear regression on K, so we share the same fit step.

    The runner's `sweep_t0` is set to the first UDP packet after job upload,
    but the printer spends 30-60+ s heating/homing/priming before the first
    burst. Using that t0 puts every per-K window inside the heatup phase
    and analysis returns NaN.

    Two-stage detection:

    1. **Coarse** -- rolling std over one cycle period. Threshold is
       relative to the GLOBAL MAX of stds (`0.25 · max_std`), not to
       the median of an arbitrary "head" window. Bursts produce std
       far larger than any pre-burst transient (homing, heating-element
       click, fan ramp-up); pegging the threshold to the run's own peak
       cleanly separates the burst region from everything before it.
       Then we require the threshold to be sustained for at least
       `min_sustain_cycles` cycles -- this rejects short loud spikes
       (loadcell tap, single mechanical event) that happen to exceed
       the threshold.

       The previous implementation pegged the threshold to "median of
       the first 25% of stds + 8·MAD", which is fooled when pre-burst
       noise (e.g. the user's case: M109-park motion at t≈22 s with
       loadcell std 130) lands inside the "head" window and pushes the
       baseline up so the burst region never registers as a clear
       outlier. Worse, the homing transient itself can exceed the
       threshold and the detector returns a t somewhere in the homing
       phase. Run inspection on the user's NPZ showed this returning
       t=7 s when the actual bursts start at t=100 s.

    2. **Fine** -- cross-correlate the (detrended) force trace against
       a model square wave, restricted to a narrow ±2-cycle window
       around the coarse estimate. The argmax there is the K=0 burst
       start, accurate to a sample.

    Sub-cycle precision matters: the per-K phase-lag fitter searches over
    ±1 s, so a `t0` error larger than one cycle aliases the lag estimate
    to the search-window boundary and the fit becomes meaningless.

    For each slow→fast (direction +1) and fast→slow (direction −1) crossing
    of the command's mid-level, integrate (F − local_mean) over half_win
    samples on either side. Each cycle uses its OWN local mean (over the
    [t_rise-hw, t_fall+hw] span around that cycle's two transitions), so
    slow loadcell drift across a 17-min sweep doesn't bias the per-K
    metric. Two windows that bracket the same transition cannot overlap:
    each is clipped at the midpoint between adjacent transitions.

    Why centered, not forward-only:

    - Forward-only windows make leads (force-leads-command, K < K_opt) and
      lags (K > K_opt) asymmetric: a small lead "costs" nothing (window
      stays inside the post-transition plateau) while a matching lag eats
      window time at the start. The fit slope then biases K_opt toward
      higher K. Centered windows are symmetric in lead/lag and produce a
      clean zero-crossing at K_opt.

    Why a NARROW window (≈ melt-pressure τ, not "as wide as fits"):

    - The U1 reference cycles 1.0 s slow + 0.25 s fast, so 0.5·fast_half
      naturally caps the U1 window at ~125 ms half-width. Their algorithm
      is implicitly tuned for that physical scale: ~1-2 melt-pressure
      time-constants, dominated by the transient response.
    - On our 2.0 s + 1.0 s cycle, "0.5·fast_half" is 500 ms — 4× too wide.
      A 600 ms total window is filled mostly with plateau samples (the
      transient is over by ~150 ms), so the metric reads "average plateau
      bias", drifts with loadcell zero, and reports K_opt ~30-50% too high.
      Replaying run_1779016571 with a 300 ms cap: K_opt=0.061; with a
      150 ms cap: K_opt=0.057 — much closer to the bd_pressure
      overshoot/undershoot crossover (~0.051), the user's expected range,
      and less sensitive to high-K saturation tails.
    - Setting the cap at 150 ms ties the window to physics (one to two
      hotend τ) instead of geometry, so the metric behaves the same way
      on U1-style short cycles and our longer cycles.

    `window_s` defaults to whichever is smaller: 150 ms or half the
    shortest leg duration (so windows never bleed into adjacent
    transitions).

    `transition_idx` / `directions` (optional): when supplied, these are
    used directly instead of mid-level crossings of the command wave. The
    intended supplier is pos_x velocity sign-flips -- the printer's actual
    leg-transition timestamps, which beat the model command wave's
    transitions because the model assumes perfect periodicity from the
    burst start while reality has per-cycle planner / accel-limit jitter.
    Direction convention: +1 = slow→fast (E rises, pos_x peak), -1 =
    fast→slow (E falls, pos_x trough).

    sign of velocity transitions from non-positive (settled or fast-leg-

    Implementation: smooth the velocity with a ~100 ms moving average

    Returns (times, directions) where:

      * direction +1 = pos_x reversed from increasing to decreasing, i.e.
        a peak. In the sweep gcode the slow leg moves X from x_base to
        x_base+dx (X increasing) and the fast leg returns (X decreasing),
        so a peak is the slow→fast transition in E (commanded velocity
        rising). Matches `_integral_area`'s "above crossings" convention.
      * direction −1 = pos_x reversed from decreasing to increasing, i.e.
        a trough = fast→slow transition = E velocity falling.

    Why sticky-delta instead of smoothed-velocity sign-flips:

    Buddy reports pos_x at ~56-80 Hz with a quantization step around
    0.05-0.1 mm. With coupled_dx_mm=1 and fast_half_s=0.8 s, the
    fast-leg velocity is ~1.25 mm/s, so the position advances ~22 µm
    between consecutive pos samples — BELOW the firmware's reporting
    resolution. The firmware emits stair-stepped pos_x: many samples
    at one value, then a sudden jump. `np.gradient` on this produces
    huge velocity spikes alternating with zero plateaus, and any
    smoothed-velocity sign-detector fires repeatedly inside one real
    leg (observed: 6 transitions in 0.84 s of what should be one
    fast leg on the user's 2026-05 NPZ).

    The sticky-delta approach is robust to quantization. We compute
    `delta = pos_x[i] − last_committed_x`. As long as delta stays
    inside ±deadband, the direction is held. Once |delta| ≥ deadband,
    the sign of delta becomes the new committed direction, and
    last_committed_x is updated. A real transition is emitted only on
    a sign change of the committed direction.

    `deadband_frac` is fraction of the observed pos_x oscillation
    amplitude (default 20%). Auto-discovered from `np.percentile(pos_x,
    95) − np.percentile(pos_x, 5)`, with a 0.02 mm minimum so a

    Three-stage pipeline:
      1. **Detect** every cycle start (slow-leg start) via velocity
         sign-flip in pos_x.
      2. **Anchor**: find the first run of `n_validation + 1` consecutive
         detected starts spaced at `cycle_period_s` (±30%). Anything
         earlier is junk (park trajectory, planner-lookahead jitter
         during M-code processing, homing transients) and discarded.
      3. **Rectify**: starting at the anchor, walk through detected
         starts and produce a clean period-spaced sequence:
           * Drop "too-close" detections (gap < 0.5·period): false
             positives, usually duplicates from a noisy velocity ramp.
           * Fill "too-far" gaps (> 1.5·period): a missed cycle. Insert
             synthetic starts at `previous + period` until the gap fits.
         This rectified sequence is what the per-K chunking consumes,
         so a single missed/extra mid-sweep detection no longer slides
         every downstream K window by one cycle (the user reported
         exactly this: late-sweep K plot looks aligned, earlier K plots
         look empty -- happens when one extra detection at the front
         pushes K[0..N-2] off by one and the last K's window happens to
         land on the real last burst's cycles by coincidence).

    Returns (sweep_t0, data_windows) on success, (None, None) when:
      * too few cycle starts detected to cover every K
      * no periodic run found (data is too noisy or no bursts present)
      * after rectification, fewer cycles remain than the plan expects.

    `notes`, when supplied, receives diagnostic lines about how many
    cycles were detected vs expected, how many were skipped/inserted,
    and the per-K start times in sweep-relative seconds. These are
    invaluable for diagnosing future misalignments from offline screenshots.

    The burst signal has a long slow plateau and a brief fast plateau,

    when X amplitude is small.

    Implementation:
      * Slice the trace to [t_lo, t_hi] (default: full range). The

    """Plan-direct K windows: use `start_offset_s` and `duration_s` exactly.

    The G-code generator is the ground truth for the sweep schedule. It
    knows the per-segment start times relative to `sweep_t0` AND it
    encodes any non-uniform cycle behaviour (e.g. K[0] cycle 0 is
    `warmup_factor × slow_half + fast_half` long instead of the usual
    `slow_half + fast_half`, so the very first segment can be 11 s while
    every later K is 3 s). Slicing directly from `seg.start_offset_s`
    and `seg.duration_s` therefore handles warm-up, accel ramps, and
    any future per-segment quirks without needing the analyser to
    rediscover them from edge detection.

    This is the preferred slicer whenever we have a trusted anchor (the
    Z-marker pulse is unambiguous when emitted). Force/pos_x edge
    detection only earns its keep when the anchor itself is uncertain.

    Returns one `(t_lo, t_hi)` pair per segment in sweep-relative
    seconds, where `t_lo = seg.start_offset_s` and `t_hi = t_lo +
    seg.duration_s`. The caller may extend `t_hi` to include the
    trailing slow leg of the following K (matches existing display
    convention).

    """Slice K windows directly from pos_x leg-direction transitions.

    pos_x is the most reliable cycle-boundary signal we have:
      * Each commanded cycle drives the toolhead a known `coupled_d*_mm`
        away from purge and back. The sign-of-delta detector emits one
        +1 (slow→fast = X reverses from rising to falling) and one -1
        (fast→slow = X reverses from falling to rising) per cycle.
      * The transitions are physically guaranteed -- the toolhead
        actually moved -- so unlike force-trace threshold crossings they
        don't fail under purge spikes or under-amplified plateaus.
      * They land at the actual cycle moment regardless of any firmware
        processing delay between gcode parse and motion execution.

    The third point is why this slicer is preferred over plan-direct
    slicing whenever pos_x oscillation is available: on the user's
    run_1779100636 the gap between Z-marker DOWN (the supposed sweep_t0)
    and the FIRST pos_x +1 transition was ~2.3 s longer than the
    plan's predicted 10.5 s, almost certainly because M572 / M83 /
    G1-with-XYZ planner-sync took ~2.3 s the plan can't see. Plan-
    direct slicing put every K window 2.3 s before the data; pos_x-
    transition slicing puts them on the data.

    Algorithm (DATA-DRIVEN for K[0], plan-driven for K[1..]):
      1. Detect all pos_x transitions via `_detect_pos_transitions`.
      2. Strip leading -1s that come BEFORE the first +1 (those are
         pre-burst rebounds, not real cycles).
      3. Require at least `2 × total_cycles` transitions remaining,
         alternating (+1, -1).
      4. K[0]'s first slow leg start is detected from the DATA, not the
         plan: scan pos_x backwards from the first +1 transition for
         the latest time pos_x sat within `0.5·amplitude` of the pre-
         burst baseline. That instant is when the toolhead actually
         started moving. We use this instead of inverting
         `K[0].duration_s` because the plan's `first_slow_leg_factor`
         may be wrong on replay (NPZ dumps did not store it), and the
         data is always authoritative.
      5. For each K[i]:
         * t_lo: start of K[i] cycle 0's slow leg. i=0 → detected K[0]
           motion start from step 4. i>0 → -1 transition of K[i-1]'s
           last cycle (slow leg of K[i] starts where K[i-1] ended).
         * t_hi: -1 transition of K[i]'s last cycle.
      6. Refine sweep_t0 from K[0]'s detected slow leg start:
         `refined_t0 = K[0]_slow_start - K[0].start_offset_s`.

    Returns `(windows, refined_sweep_t0)` on success, `None` on any
    structural mismatch (wrong number of transitions, non-alternating
    pattern, etc.).

    #      below the slow plateau and cycles never go below it -- the

    #      9 edges detected out of 11 expected, then 6 of those weren't
    #      cycle starts at all.

    #      to cycle 1 start is much longer than `cycle_period_s`. The
    #      rolling-anchor prediction with a uniform period therefore
    #      lands cycle 0 in the wrong slot.

        #      cycle-timing signal we have — each slow→fast transition
        #      shows up as an unambiguous mid-level crossing. We use
        #      `_detect_force_cycle_starts` for the rising side and
        #      synthesize the falling side at `rising + fast_half_s`
        #      (the fast leg's commanded duration). This decisively
        #      beats pos_x in two scenarios we've observed on real
        #      hardware: (a) when the user's gcode has tiny or no
        #      XY coupling, pos_x doesn't oscillate on every cycle and
        #      pos_x transitions correspond to coarser features (K-to-K
        #      moves) instead of per-cycle boundaries; (b) when pos_x
        #      reporting is delayed relative to motion, the detected
        #      "peaks" sit late and the resulting segment windows
        #      sample the wrong leg of the cycle entirely (manifests
        #      as `baseline_median > high_level`, a giant `noise_std`,
        #      and bogus "rise below noise" exclusions on visibly
        #      clean data).
        #
        #   2. pos_x detected transitions. Useful when the user
        #      configured large XY coupling and the position trace is
        #      clean and aligned with the force signal.
        #
        #   3. Model synthesis from `cycle_period_s` + `slow_half_s`
